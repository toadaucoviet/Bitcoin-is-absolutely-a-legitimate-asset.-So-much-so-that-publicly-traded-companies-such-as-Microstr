In some ways, buying Bitcoin is much like buying any other currency. You always need to be mindful that its price rises and falls compared to other currencies.  One way Bitcoin is different than traditional investments is that you either need to hold the coins yourself or trust a third party to do it.  If you hold them yourself, there is the risk that you donâ€™t store them properly and lose them forever.  If you let a third party hold them for you, they may get hacked. And unlike storing dollars or stocks, once the coins are hacked, they cannot be easily replaced.
